I'm a student pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Florida State University with an expected graduation date in May 2026.

In my free time I work on Full-Stack web application development. I am familiar with and actively use such technologies as React.js, Next.js, C# ASP.NET, TailwindCSS, MSSQL, MongoDB, Prisma, Auth.js, JWT, Zod and many other wonderful web frameworks, libraries and technologies.
